###### The idea of the project is creating a VR Theme Park. I haven’t done much in the scene yet:

###### The Ferris wheel is the only interesting part of it all, I am trying on animating it but it is taking some time.

###### I have implemented VR hands, but, for now, they just have a grip animation. I am planning on providing some more animations.
###### Feel free to steal the code for hand implementation in your own projects 😋 ( *Lets be honest implementing hands in VR is tough, at least for beginners* )
